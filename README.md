# sudoku_Project1
My sudoku game in C++, played on terminal with graphic. 
- The first version, sudoku.cpp is a basic Sudoku game
- The second one, sudoku_with_time.cpp is elevated with count down clock, but it is incomplete since I haven't been able to deal with multi thread and couldn't kill it when the game end.
